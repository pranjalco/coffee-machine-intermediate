# Project 11: Coffee Machine
## Description:
This Coffee Machine project is a Python-based program that simulates a real-world coffee vending machine. 
It allows users to select from available drinks, processes payments, and dispenses coffee based on sufficient 
resources. It also includes functionality for resource management and a maintenance mode to check resources 
and earnings.

### Features:
- Simulates a coffee machine offering multiple drink options (espresso, latte, cappuccino).
- Validates user input for drink selection and payment.
- Calculates and processes payments using coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).
- Checks resource availability before making a drink.
- Tracks and updates resource levels after each use.
- Displays reports for resources and earnings in maintenance mode.
- Designed for interactive use in a command-line interface.

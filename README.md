# Project 11: Coffee Machine

## Description:
This Coffee Machine project is a Python-based program that simulates a real-world coffee vending machine. It allows users to select from available drinks, processes payments, and dispenses coffee based on sufficient resources. It also includes functionality for resource management and a maintenance mode to check resources and earnings.

## How to Use:
1. Start the program to power on the coffee machine simulation.  
2. Choose a drink by entering the name (espresso, latte, or cappuccino).  
3. Insert coins as prompted (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).  
4. Confirm your payment; if sufficient, your drink will be prepared.  
5. If resources are insufficient, a message will notify you, and the process will restart.  
6. Use the 'report' option to view the current status of machine resources and earnings.  
7. Use the 'off' option to turn off the coffee machine simulation.

- Validates user input for drink selection and payment.
- Calculates and processes payments using coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).
- Checks resource availability before making a drink.
- Tracks and updates resource levels after each use.
- Displays reports for resources and earnings in maintenance mode.
- Designed for interactive use in a command-line interface.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranjalco/coffee-machine-intermediate.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd coffee-machine-intermediate

## Running the Program
1. Ensure Python 3.9 or later is installed on your system.
2. To run the program:
   - **Using PyCharm**: Open the project in PyCharm and run `app.py`.
   - **Using Terminal/Command Prompt**: Navigate to the project folder and execute:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - **By Double-Clicking**: You can double-click `app.py` to run it directly, provided Python is set up to execute `.py` files on your system.
3. If the console window closes immediately, run the program from the terminal/command prompt or IDE to see the output.
